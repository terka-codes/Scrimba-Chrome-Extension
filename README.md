# MyLeads Chrome Extension
This is a simple Chrome Extension that allows you to save and manage your favorite links. You can add links manually by typing them into the input field, or you can add the link of the current tab by clicking on the "Save Tab" button. You can also delete all your saved links by double-clicking on the "Delete All" button.

## How it Works ðŸ’»
The Chrome Extension uses the Chrome Extension API to access the active tab's URL and saves the links in the extension's local storage. The render() function is used to display the saved links in an unordered list below the input field. The user can add new links to the list by typing them into the input field and clicking on the "Save" button. The user can also save the link of the active tab by clicking on the "Save Tab" button. The user can delete all the saved links by double-clicking on the "Delete All" button.

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to save and manage website URLs. You can save URLs by clicking the "Save" button or by clicking the "Tab" button to save the current tab's URL. You can also delete saved URLs by double-clicking the "Delete" button.

I customized the CSS of the Chrome extension to make it look visually appealing and user-friendly. By adding custom styles, I was able to improve the overall user experience of the extension and make it stand out from other similar extensions.

As a developer, I believe that the design and user interface of a product are just as important as its functionality. A well-designed product can greatly enhance its usability and appeal to users. By customizing the CSS of this Chrome extension, I aimed to create a product that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing to users.

### Install the Extension
- Download the extension's source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.

- Make sure the "Developer mode" switch is toggled on, located in the top-right corner of the page.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button located in the top-left corner of the page.
- In the file browser window that appears, navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension's source code and click "Select folder".

Note: Manually installing extensions can be less secure than installing them from the Chrome Web Store, so it's important to only install extensions from trusted sources.
